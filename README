pokemon game! 
Added for 1.10: pokebucks to be won from trainers and able to be spent on items at the pokemart,
added pokemon storage for pokemon caught after the first 6 that can be accessed and swapped at the pokecenter, 
changed catch rates for pokemon, so the pokeball can miss or the pokemon can escape from the ball.
Also added bonuses for attack-types going against certain defending types.

command 'g' puts a random pokemon into storage
'p' shows current pokemon

in the terminal do make, then run assignment1_10
